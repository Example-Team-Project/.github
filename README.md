# Example Team Project

This project aims to create a more or less complete Microservice Architetcture based setup.

## Data structure

The database is coming from the [www.postgresqltutorial.com](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/) website.

The page aims to learn how to use PostgreSQL, but the datastructure and the initial data in it fits perfectly for this small project.

## Planned setup

The project aims to use [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) with **reactive** setup where it is applicable.
